# XrAI - Pathology Detection in Chest X-rays
The XrAI project tackles the challenge of identifying pneumonic pathologies in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It primarily focus on detecting pneumonia and tuberculosis, but the approach can seamlessly extend to other pathologies that manifest through radiologic analysis. This repository offers a set of solutions for addressing the complexities inherent in data preprocessing, model development, and result analysis and interpretation for  such models. The result of our efforts is a powerful and accurate tool that is able to discern when is possible to make informed predictions and when, on the other hand, the input data isn't informative enough for clinical assessments.

## Authors and Acknowledgments
XrAI is the result of the collective efforts of Chiara Boscarino, Filippo Castellani, and Federico Cavallini, three master's students at Politecnico di Milano.
We developed this project within the framework of V. Corino's "[Methods & Applications of AI in Biomedicine](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=788164&__pj0=0&__pj1=552e8bace80cad6c09cc7d90548cde8f )(2022/23)" course in the Biomedical Engineering program at Politecnico di Milano.
